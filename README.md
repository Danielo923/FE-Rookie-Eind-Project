<h1>My palworld webshop pages</h1>
<p>I have been working on my project. For this project I have made a webshop about Palworld.<br>
I have made a <a href="https://danielo923.github.io/FE-Rookie-Eind-Project/">normal view</a> and an <a href="https://danielo923.github.io/FE-Rookie-Eind-Project/admin.html">admin view</a>.</p>
<p>I have been working on this project for around 2 weeks, and have made a vew features in my webshop.</p>
<h1>Main page</h1>
<p>First i have made a simple nav bar that can redirect you to the main page and the cart page. On my main page you can see all the pal that you can buy. Every pal has it's own card with their own information, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>A picture of the pal</li>
<li>Their name</li>
<li>A discription about them</li>
<li>The price to pay for them</li>
<li>A button to add them to the cart</li>
</ul>
<p>By pressing the add to cart button the pal will be added to a local storage. In this local storage will be all of the pals that you add to the card.</p>
<p>I have also added a few ways to clear your whole local storage on the main page. You can do this by either click the c button on your keyboard, or by clicking the logo 3 times within 3 seconds.</p>
<h1>Cart</h1>
<p>In my cart page you will have your cart, and a button that will send you back to the main page, and an extra button that wont do very much but send you to the cart page where you already are.</p>
<p>On the bottom of your screen you can also see thee total credits you need to pay in order to buy the pals and you have a purchase button. This button can only be pressed when you have something in your cart. If you do have something in your cart and click the purchase butten, then you will be redirected to a page to thank you for you purchase.</p>
<h1>Admin page</h1>
<p>On this page you can see all of the products that are available at default. In the nav bar you can see a few things:<p>
<ul>
<li>A button to send you to the main page</li>
<li>A button to see all the products</li>
<li>A button to see purchases</li>
<li>A button that adds an item to the store (if you go back to the main page you can see that it is disabled until you change the name with the edit button)</li>
<li>A button that only resets the items that can be puchased</li>
</ul>
<p>When you are on the <strong>All Products</strong> part of the page you can do a few things, like:
<u;>
<li>Edit the product</li>
<li>Delete the product</li>
</ul>
<p>On the <strong>Edit Page</strong> you will see a few things, like:</p>
<ul>
<li>The name of the pal</li>
<li>The price of the pal</li>
<li>The description of the pal</li>
<li>The picture of the pal</li>
<li>An edit button that will save your changes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you go back and go to the <strong>Purchases</strong> than you will see the puchases that were made. If there are no purchases than there won't be anything there to see</p>
